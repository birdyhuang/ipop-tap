SocialVPN - P2P VPN for Friends

How to compile
--------------

For Linux:

Make sure you have OpenSSL installed

aptitude install libssl-dev openssl
make

For Android:

Download OpenSSL for Android https://github.com/eighthave/openssl-android

Download the Android NDK

Build OpenSSL for Android

Update the Android.mk file under svpn/android/jni to the correct path of your OpenSSL library

cd svpn/android/jni

NDK-path/ndk-build


How to run
----------

Run as root, process drops privileges to nobody after configuring tap device

cd src
sudo ./svpn

or alternatively

sudo make exec

First you have to set a unique id

setid alice

Now you can add a friend with the following format

add <friend id> <friend ip> <friend port> <shared symmetric key>

for example:

add bob 192.168.0.101 5800 sharekey1234


How to configure
----------------

If you want to configure port number or tap IP address, you have to modify svpn.c main function.

Warning
-------

At the moment this is simply a conceptual prototype, the encryption is really insecure, and
does not defend against many types of attacks (i.e. replay). A smarter solution will be to
use TLS or DTLS from OpenSSL, but that's for a future date.
